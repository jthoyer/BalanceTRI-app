# Balance Tri Club — Race commitment prototype

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. The prototype supports member selection, race filtering, commitments, custom event distances, and adding new races.

## Backend

Data is stored in Supabase (project **Balance Tri Club**, `shkfwuogrldbqldpipxd`). `app.js` connects directly with the project's public URL and anon/publishable key — both are safe to expose client-side.

Schema (`public` schema):

- **races** — `id`, `name`, `date`, `location`, `url`, `slug` (text, unique, not null — see *Shareable race URLs* below), `events` (text array), `event_type` (text — Triathlon, Swim, Bike, Run, Multi-sport, or Balance Bolt), `club_focus` (boolean — set from the "Club focus race" checkbox, except for Balance Bolt races, which the app always saves as `true`; the checkbox is hidden in the form while Balance Bolt is the selected event type), `balance_bolt` (boolean — hides the club commitments/your commitment sections on the race card, since sign-up happens on the separate Balance Bolt site; the app sets this automatically from `event_type === 'Balance Bolt'` rather than exposing a separate form field), `created_at`
- **entries** — `id`, `race_id` (references `races`), `name`, `event`, `level`, `created_at`, unique on `(race_id, name)`
- **profiles** — `id` (references `auth.users`), `display_name`, `justgo_status` (`unverified` / `verified` / `not_found` — reserved for a future JustGo membership check, unused for now), `justgo_member_number`, `justgo_checked_at`, `created_at`

Row Level Security is enabled on all three tables. `races` and `entries` keep policies that allow anonymous read/write, matching this app's no-login, honour-system trust model (members identify themselves by typing their name — there's no account or password required to add a race or commitment). `profiles` is different: each row is readable and writable only by the signed-in user it belongs to (`auth.uid() = id`).

## Sign-in

Sign-in is optional and doesn't gate anything yet — it's there so returning members don't have to retype their name. `app.js` uses Supabase Auth's email magic-link flow (`signInWithOtp`): entering an email sends a link, and opening it signs the browser in. The `handle_new_user` trigger (in the `add_profiles_table` migration) creates a matching `profiles` row the first time someone signs in, seeding `display_name` from the email's local part. Once signed in, that `display_name` fills the "Your name" field automatically (but never overwrites a name already typed in this browser).

A dismissible banner nudges signed-out visitors to sign in; "Not now" snoozes it for 30 days (tracked client-side in `localStorage`, not in Supabase) rather than hiding it forever. The small sign-in control in the header stays available regardless.

## Shareable race URLs

Every race has its own address: `<site-base>/race/<slug>`, e.g.
<https://jthoyer.github.io/BalanceTRI-app/race/berlin-marathon-2026>. Opening
that link goes straight to the race's detail screen; opening a race from the
list updates the address bar to match, and browser back/forward move between
the list and a race.

**Slugs are generated in the database, not in the app.** The
`races_slug_biu` trigger derives `slug` from the race name plus the year of its
date (`Berlin Marathon` + 2026 → `berlin-marathon-2026`), prefixes Balance Bolt
races (which are named by number) with `balance-bolt-`, and appends `-2`, `-3`…
on a collision. Nobody types a slug. `app.js` never writes the column — it only
reads it — so `addRace`/`updateRace` need no slug handling and an older cached
copy of the app keeps working.

Renaming a race, or changing its date, regenerates the slug and therefore
**breaks links already shared for that race**. Unrelated edits (URL, events,
club-focus flag) leave the slug alone. A slug can also be set by hand in SQL,
in which case the trigger normalises it but does not overwrite it.

**GitHub Pages has no server-side rewrites**, so a cold hit on `/race/<slug>`
is served by `404.html`, which bounces to `index.html` as `<base>?/race/<slug>`;
a small script at the top of `index.html`'s `<head>` restores the real path
before `app.js` routes on it. `404.html` redirects **only** paths matching
`/race/<slug>` — a missing stylesheet, image or typo'd path still 404s
normally. Neither file hardcodes the repository name: the base is taken from
whatever precedes `/race/`, so this also works if the site ever moves to a
custom domain at the root.

A slug that matches no race falls back to the race list with an explanatory
banner, and rewrites the URL so the dead link isn't re-shared. If Supabase is
unreachable the URL is left untouched, since an unmatched slug can't be
distinguished from an unloaded one.
